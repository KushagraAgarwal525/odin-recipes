<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Boxed or frozen mac and cheese dishes don't even begin to compare to this comforting, from-scratch version that's easy, affordable, and ultra-creamy! Cheddar and cream cheese add a sharp and slightly tangy flavor to the rich sauce which coats perfectly cooked pasta. It's a great base recipe that can be tweaked to your taste by switching up the cheeses or adding some cooked veggies. Serve as a meatless main course with a green salad or as a side dish with roasted or grilled meats.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
    <li>2 (8 ounce) packages sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground mustard</li>
    <li>3½ cups whole milk, or more to taste</li>
    <li>3 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper (Optional)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add macaroni and 2 ½ teaspoons salt and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 to 6 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>Shred Cheddar cheese by hand or in a food processor; set aside.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook, whisking constantly, until smooth, 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk in mustard powder, then 3 ½ cups milk. Whisk occasionally until mixture comes to a simmer, then let simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add cream cheese and cook, stirring often, until thick, creamy, and smooth, about 5 minutes. Add remaining 1 ½ teaspoon salt, pepper, and cayenne.</li>
    <li>Stir in 2 cups shredded Cheddar. Turn off the heat and let cheese melt. Stir in cooked macaroni. Add up to ¼ cup milk if you feel like the mixture is too thick.</li>
    <li>Layer ½ of the pasta mixture in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Top with 1 ½ cups Cheddar. Spread remaining pasta mixture over top and sprinkle with remaining Cheddar.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
